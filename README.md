# ZenQuest – Gamified Stress Management App 🎯
*A User Experience Engineering (UXE) Semester 8 Project*

## 📌 Overview
**ZenQuest** is an interactive stress-relief mobile application designed for university students.  
It addresses the high abandonment rate of traditional mindfulness apps by incorporating **gamification**, **mindfulness mini-games**, and **emergency relief tools** into a user-friendly and engaging experience.

Our UX research found that students often feel conventional mindfulness apps are "another assignment" rather than a source of relaxation. ZenQuest aims to be **fun, intuitive, and practical during high-stress academic moments**.
